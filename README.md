## By: Ian Norman, Nathan Elias, Bill Li
## Game Concept: This game will merge ideas from Call of Duty Zombies and being the dungeon master from DnD into one multiplayer game. Four players must work together to survive in an environment filled with AI-controlled enemies while a fifth player spawns in the enemies in a fashion similar to a TTRPG.
## Core Gameplay Mechanics:
* Four Survivors: Players must scavenge for resources, manage weapons, and strategize to survive waves of AI enemies.
* Dungeon Master (DM): The fifth player controls enemy spawns, environmental hazards, and game events.
* Progressive Difficulty: As rounds advance, AI enemies become stronger, new enemies and environment changes appear, and survivors must adapt to the environment.
## Game Components:
# Objects:
* Playable Characters: Four PCâ€™s will be allowed to choose from set weapons.
* Enemies: Various AI-controlled minions, ranging from basic hordes to an elite boss enemy.
* DM Tools: Spawn enemies, buff enemies, and use map-altering abilities to influence gameplay.
* Weapons & Equipment: Crossbows, melee weapons, and defensive tools.
# Attributes:
* DM Customization: Choose from a number of enemies and enemy buffs given a limited budget.
* Scoring System: Survivors earn points based on defeated enemies and time survived.
* Possible Additions: Spawnable enemies change based on survivor performance, Options to set difficulty.
# Relationships:
* Survivors vs AI: Survivors must work together to survive against enemies.
* Survivors vs DM: The DM has control over enemy spawns therefore making games feel unique.
* DM vs Environment: The DM has limited constraints to buff minions and challenge the survivors.
